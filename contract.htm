<h1>
Cory Norton's WEB 215 Course Contract
</h1>

<div id="date">
 <p>Date & Time: <script type="text/javascript">  displayDate(); </script>
 </p>
 </div>


<p>
    I, Cory Norton agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
	Fall 2013, WEB 215, Section 85, Adv Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
</p>
<p>
    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world,
	and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>
<p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
	As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>
<p>
    Signed: Cory Norton, August 25, 2013
